# [Personal Bio](https://github.com/Muthubioinfo/muthubio)

I am a computational biologist primarily on studying molecular evolution and phylogenetics. 

I love to play with new empirical data to understand their patterns of variation using the appropriate statistical inferrence methods. 
I majorly do coding in R, Python, and also MATLAB and currently advancing my levels of programming in C/C++ and Julia languages.
