### My story

I write my personal story in context of me as the 'pearl' aka 'Muthu'. I refer pinactada as females, crabs as males, even though it doesn't have biological sense because this is story like spongebob squarepants.

In a strange land of ..., there was a group of pinactada trying their best to live a harmonious life. All they could produce is one pearl at a time in their nacre, because of the selective pressures Among them, this one pinactada failed to produce a pearl from her nacre. The other pinactadas treated her badly, because she cannot produce on her first attempt.

She didn't give up instantly, but with the helps of the crab friends and support from a few snails, she tried to make a pearl again. This time she prayed to the peacock (God) to bless her with a pearl that doesnt go away. This time she did make one, but didn't make it until the final stage to survive. 

The pinactada went into hole of darkness, losing all hope from her accomplises. She almost gave up of trying another pearl. Her health was deteriorating until Dr. pinactada gave hope to try out again. The pinactada never listened to the nonsenses that other pinactadas and the crabs said. She kept going all with hopes and prayers to the peacock for that one pearl she need in her life to support her and understand her, inspite the world hated her. She know the pearl will be a male... And she finally got that pearl. When she got that pearl, even the hated crabs, and other pinactadas celebrated, because all their bad monsters faded away, when they saw the new pearl.

The new pearl was in satin blue color. The color no one had hoped. This pearl was one of a character growing up. The mother pinactada gave all the love she had in her heart. She believed her pearl will  
touch the heights no one would for. She knew this because she knew that the peacock has already blessed the pearl.
