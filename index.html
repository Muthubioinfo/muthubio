title: Muthukumaran Panchaksaram, PhD
subtitle: I am Muthu. I am a computational biologist with particular interest in statistical inference of phylogenetic trees. My research focusses specifically on the different model selection approaches – Likelihood ratio test and Bayes factor analysis – to identify the most suitable statistical models for inferring substitution rates, evolutionary rates, and species divergence times from genomic data.
